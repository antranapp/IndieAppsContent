  Longplay is an iOS app for music lovers who enjoy listening to full albums but have a hard time finding them in their music library. It provides a beautiful view of the album artworks of the (near) complete albums in your music library with one-tap access to play them. It works well with Apple Music.

releaseNotes:
  - version: 1.0 (12)
    note: |- 
      This build changes the play/pause icons to reflect the action that'll happen (i.e., start playing or pausing) rather than the current state (is playing or is paused) to make this consistent with iOS controls.
      Thanks for the feedback of the beta so far to everyone. If all goes well with App Store review, Longplay will be available on the App Store soon.
