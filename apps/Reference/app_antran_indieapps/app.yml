description: |- 
  Have you worked on some side projects but couldn't finish them becasue you lost interest quickly?
  Do you have a cool product but you can't find any early testers/adopters?

  This is a platform to showcase your projects as early as possible to other fellow developers/early adopters.

  Sharing your projects early is very helpful to keep you motivated, to gather early feedbacks and to adapt your projects to serve not only you but also others.
