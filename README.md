# Content for Indie Apps Showcases

This is the repository used to provide content to [the Indie Apps Showcases app](https://github.com/antranapp/IndieApps).

## Sample

Please take a look at the files in [this folder](https://github.com/antranapp/IndieAppsContent/tree/master/apps/Reference/app.antran.IndieApps) to see how you can add your app into this repository.

The icon should be **256x256** in size. Please don't add too big icons since in the worst case, users will have to clone the whole repo again into their apps.

Please make sure that you follow the format carefully. In the future, I'll setup some kinds of CI to validate the pull requests automatically.
